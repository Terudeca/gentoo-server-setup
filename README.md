<p align="center">**Intro**

<p align="center">First of all let me state: <br>**I'm not insane**.<br><br> I have a few Gentoo based servers with a long uptime - and I bet there are working a way better than any Ubuntu, CentOS,.. server I used in the past.<br><br> I know - this is a **bold** statement to say things like that. So let me explain:
<p align="left">1. Continous uptime without the need of reboot to switch to the new version of the kernel, services,etc..
<p align="left">2. System is fully customisable, every single part can be adjusted as you like it, every daemon, service - you decide what you want - not the distro maintainers with tedious dependencies forcing you to use THAT version of software.
<p align="left">3. Low resource footprint (really lower than anything else I have used in the past).
