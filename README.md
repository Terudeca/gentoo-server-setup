<p align="center">**Intro**

<p align="center">I'm not insane. I have a few Gentoo based servers and I bet there are working a way better than any Ubuntu, CentOS,..  server. I know - this is a **bold** statement to say things like that. So let me explain:
<p align="left">1. Continous uptime without the need of reboot to switch to the new version of the kernel.
<p align="left">2. System is fully customisable, every single part can be adjusted as you like it, every daemon, service - you decide what you want - not the distro maintainers with tedious dependencies.
<p align="left">3. Low resource footprint (lower than Debian - really or anything else I used in the past).
